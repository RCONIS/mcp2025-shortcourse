# Short Course: Good Software Engineering Practice for R Packages

**MCP 2025 Philadelphia, USA**

Tuesday August 12, 2025 1:30 pm - 5:10 pm EST

This course aims to equip participants with the essential software engineering practices required to develop and maintain robust R packages. With the growing demand for reproducible research and the increasing complexity of statistical methods developed e.g. for MCP methodology, writing high-quality R packages has become a critical skill for statisticians to prototype, develop, and disseminate novel methods (incl. for MCP) and push their adoption in practice. The course will focus on the key principles of software engineering, such as workflows, modular design, version control, testing, documentation, and quality indicators. Focusing on these aspects ensures the reliability and sustainability of R packages. Examples will be given from R packages implementing MCP, such as rpact.

## Speaker

### Daniel Sabanés Bové

Dr. Daniel Sabanés Bové studied statistics at LMU Munich, Germany and obtained his PhD at the University of Zurich, Switzerland in 2013 for his research work on Bayesian model selection. He started his career in Roche as a biostatistician for 5 years, then continued at Google as a data scientist for 2 years, before rejoining Roche as a statistical software engineering lead for 4 years. In 2024, Daniel co-founded RCONIS (Research Consulting and Innovative Solutions). He is (co-)author of multiple R packages published on CRAN and Bioconductor, as well as the book "Likelihood and Bayesian Inference: With Applications in Biology and Medicine". He is currently a co-chair of the openstatsware working group on Software Engineering in Biostatistics (see https://openstatsware.org).
